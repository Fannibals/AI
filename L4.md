## Generating Heuristic Functions

### 1. How to construct heuristic functions automatically
+ “Relax”ing is a methodology to construct heuristic functions
+ <img src="https://github.com/Fannibals/AI/blob/master/pics/Relax.png" width= 700, height = 300> 

+ Example: 8-Puzzle
  - Original's Action: A tile can move from Square A to B if A is adjacent to B and B is blank.
    - Relaxation: without the limitation of being blank
    - A tile can move from square A to square B
    
+ Example: Goal-Counting  ???
  - Need to approximate the perfect heuristic h'∗ for P'.  
    Hence goal counting: just approximate h'∗ by number-of-false-goals.
    
### 2. How to Relax Formally    

+ Definition and properties

+ What if R is not efficiently construcible (3 methods)
  - approximate r / design r in a way so that it will typically be feasible
  - just live with it 
+ What if R is not efficiently computable?
  - same as above h'*

+ Goal-counting again
  - Native?
    - YES, 
  - Efficiently constructible
    - YES
  - Efficiently computable
    - NO, still NP-hard

### Truck Problem
+ dr(x,y): empty --> at(y)
+ load(x) 
  - at(x)  --> in Truck        
  - atp(x) --> not atp(x)
  - all to 
    - empty --> in Truck
