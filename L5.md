## AI week5 Delete Relaxation Heuristics

### 1. Motivation
+ Delete relaxation is a method to relax planning tasks, and thus automatically compute h.

+ Definition
	- Delete Relaxation
		- a+, when you see the plus, it also means the delete relaxed

	- Relaxed Plan
		- An optimal relaxed plan for s is also that for "sub s plus"

+ Dominance
	- s'+ dominates s+ if s+ belongs to s'+

+ Proposition of the Dominance
	- 1) if s+ is a goal state, s'+ is as well
	- 2) a->+ is applicable in s+, then it is applicable in s'+
	- 3) appl(s,a+) dominates both s and appl(s,a)
	- 4) Delete relaxation is admissible
		- the worst plan that can find, upper bound ???

### 2. Greedy Relaxed Planning
+ Proposition. 
	- Greedy relaxed planning is sound, complete, and terminates in time polynomial in the size of Î .

+ s.t such that
	- preconditions of those actions satisfied by current state
	- and the resulting of that action give me a bigger state
	- include that kind of action to your relaxed plan

+ Using greedy relaxed planning to generate h
	- safe
	- goal-aware
	- no, unless the relaxed plans were optimal

### 3. h+: The Optimal Delete Relaxation Heuristic
+ h+: optimal relax plan cost
+ h\*: optimal cost of the original task
+ h+ is admissible --> safe and goal-aware


+ example:
	- optimal vs. relaxed plan
	- relaxed: direct from sydney to all other cities

+ how to compute h+???
	- Optimal Relaxed Planning
	- PlamOpt+, NP-complete

+ h+ as a relaxation heuristic P18?
	- native relaxation? YES
	- relaxation efficiently constructible? YES
	- relaxation efficiently computable? NO
