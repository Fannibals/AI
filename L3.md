## Introduction to Planning
## How to Describe Arbitrary Search Problems

### 1. Autonomous Behaviour in AI

+ the key problem is to select the action to do next. -- control problem
  - Programming-based: specify control by hand
    - Advantage: domain-knowledge easy to express
    - Disadvantage: cannot deal with situations not anticipated by programmer
  - Learning-based: learn control from experience
    - Unsupervised  
      - Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output variables
      - Clustering and Association
    - Supervised
      - Supervised learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output. Y = f(X)
      - Classification and Regression
    - Evolutionary 
    - Advantage: does not require much knowledge in principle
    - Disadvantage: in practice, hard to know which features to learn, and is slow
 
  - Model-based: Specify problem by hand, derive control automatically
    - Advantage: powerful, Quick, flexible & clear, Intelligent & domain-independent
    - Disadvantage: efficiency loss

    |a deterministic transition function s' = f(a,s) for a ∈ A(s) |a non-deterministic transition function F(a,s) ⊆ S for a ∈ A(s) |transition probabilities Pa(s0|s) for s ∈ S and a ∈ A(s) | -|- |

  - for a problem:
    - Agent A must reach G, moving one cell at a time in KNOWN map
    
    - | actions| location| planning model|
      |:---:|:---:|:---:|
      |deterministic| initial location known| Classcial planning|
      |stochastic| location observable| planning with MDP|
      |stochastic| location partially observable| POMDP|

### 2. languages and solvers
+ A planner is a solver over a class of models
  - Model => Planner => Controller
    - controller is a kind of solution(solution can be true or false)

+ ---
  - Add list => what becomes True when you apply an action
  - Delete list => what becomes False when you apply an action
  - Precondition => when can you apply a given action
  
+ PDDL 
  - PDDL = Planning Domain Definition Language
  - components:
    - • **Objects**: Things in the world that interest us.
    - • **Predicates**: Properties of objects that we are interested in; can be true or false.
    - • **Initial state**: The state of the world that we start in.
    - • **Goal specification**: Things that we want to be true.
    - • **Actions/Operators**: Ways of changing the state of the world.
  - Domain file(objects, So, Sg) and Problem file(predicates and the operators..)
  
### 3. Algorithmic Problems in Planning
+ Satisficing Planning
  - PlanEx (whether exists a plan for a given task P)
+ Optimal Planning
  - PlanLen(whether exists a plan for P of length at most B)
  
### 4. Terms
+ Turing Machine
  - non-deterministic Turing machine
    - whenever you do an action, the outcome can be serveral places
+ NP
  - problems that can be solved in polynominal time
  - P就是能在多项式时间内解决的问题，NP就是能在多项式时间验证答案正确与否的问题
+ PSPACE
+ relation:  Non-deterministic polynomial space can be simulated in deterministic polynomial space. Thus PSPACE = NPSPACE, and hence (trivially) NP subset PSPACE.

+ NP problems: exponential time in the worst case to solve it.
  - run out of space very quickly


+ Theorem
  - both PlanEx and PlanLen are PSPACE-complete (hardest among PSPACE problems)
  
### 5. Computational Approaches
+ How to solve Strips planning problems?
  - specification
  - computation 
  - Two traditional approaches
    - search
    - decomposition
+ Computational Approaches to Classical Planning
  - heuristic search planning
  - model checking planning
  - ...
+ State of the Art
  - planning as h()
  - SAT
