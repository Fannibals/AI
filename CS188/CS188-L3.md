Search Heuristics

A heuristic is:
    - A function that estimates how close a state is to a goal
    - Designed for a particular search problem (different function it can be for different problems)
    - Examples: Manhattan / Euclidean distance

1- Greedy Search
  - Expand the node that you think is closest to a goal state
    - Heuristic: estimate of distance to nearest goal for each state
  - A common case:
    - Best-first takses you straight to the (wrong) goal
  - Worst-case
    - like a badly-guided DFS


2- A* Search
  - combining Uniform-cost and Greedy
  
  - Uniform-cost orders by path cost, or backward cost g(n) everytime it calculates the total cost
  - Greedy orders by goal proximity, or forward cost h(n)
  
  - A* search f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
